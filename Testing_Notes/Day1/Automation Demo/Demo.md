Manual Testing: Testing is done by manually.
Automation Testing: Testing is done by using automated tools.

Drawbacks of Manual Testing:
a.In Manual testing retest and regression testing is long process.
b.Test suit(collection of test case execution) execution is not possible.
c.Data Driven Testing(Testing the same functionality with multiple data) is very difficult.

Advances of Automation Testing:
a.It is faster and requires less resources & retest and Regression testing is took less time.
b.Test suit execution can be performed.
c.Data Driven testing can be done easily.

Automation Testing as different stages:
a.Functional: QTP/UFT(QuickTest Professional/ Unified Functional Testing),RFT( Rational Functional Tester),Selenium.
b.Performance:Jmeter,LoadRunner,RPT(Rational Performance Tester).
c.Project Managemant: QC/ALM,Jira.
d.Mobile Testing: Appium
e.Webservices/API Testing: Postman(Manual),SOAP UI(Automation).

Difference between QTP and Selenium
QTP:
a.Product based software & need to buy the product.
b.Limited languages are used to execute scripts(VB-Script,c#,.net).
c.Windows based tools i.e it will be worked only windows system.
d.Only supported IE browser.
e.It will be supported DESKTOP/Mobile/Webservices applications.
Selenium:
a.It is a Open source software.
b.It will supports multiple languages like JAVA/C#/.NET/PYTHON/RUBY/PERL.
c.Selenium will be support any platform like windows/linux.
d.It will support all browsers.
e.It will not supported DESKTOP/Mobile/Webservices applications.

About Selenium tools:
Selenium IDE:Record and Play(outdated).
Selenium RC: Remote comtrol to automate the websites(Outdated)
Selenium Webdriver: Latest version is used to automate the websites or applications.
Selenium Grid: used for the cross browser testing.
